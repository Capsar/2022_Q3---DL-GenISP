# Dataset
- We extracted a subset from the larger dataset: https://github.com/igor-morawski/RAW-NOD
- Subset download used in this project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLvd7f6lMrdkKvGkh7kPM5Ybmbrg_CHa/view?usp=sharing

# Model
- The model is downloaded through torchvision in `main.py` and later saved in `data/retinanet_v2_object_detector.pickle`.

Folder structure should look like the following:
- ``
data/our_nikon/...
``
- ``
data/our_sony/...
``
- ``
data/coco_resnet_50_map_0_335_state_dict.pt
``
